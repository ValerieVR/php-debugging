# PHP debugging :bug::hammer:
To get acquainted with PHP I have to debug a series of problems (see junior.php.broken-file). The final solution to these problems will be saved in the expert.php-file. To complete this challenge I have to, as always, look a lot of concepts up :sweat_smile:
This challenge was provided to me by [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg).

## :wrench: Tools
- Visual Studio Code
